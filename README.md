# 🏋️‍♂️ FitLand Online Shop  

##  📖   About Project
**FitLand** is an online sports equipment store built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**.  
This project was a great learning experience for me and came with many challenges.  
Some of the key challenges included implementing a **fully responsive design** for different devices,  
working with **dynamic routing** in Next.js, managing the **cart system**,  
and creating reusable **UI components** to keep the code clean and scalable.  



The goal of this project was not only to build a modern online shop,  
but also to practice real-world front-end development skills and improve my workflow with modern tools.
